# MNIST Classification with TensorFlow2.0

Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification using TensorFlow 2.0

The source data set is called MNIST and contains 70,000 handwritten digits (28x28 pixels each - 1 digit per image)
The goal was to write an algorithm whitch can detect the handwritten image using Tensorflow 2.0
The final test accuracy amounted 98%

Note: The installation of Tensorflow2.0 and MNIST data set required prior to the algorithm run.
